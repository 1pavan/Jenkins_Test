both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The system will replace the 'X' with a specific LT Code on delivery of the message according to the delivery control exercised by the receiving user.

The Branch Code is mandatory and will be validated. The default of 'XXX' may be used, as in the example above.

Unless otherwise documented, system messages addressed to the SWIFT system itself should be addressed to SWFTXXXXXXXX.

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

		<description><![CDATA[This message is used for monitoring FIN Copy Service Messages within a specific time range.Unless the range is set, it defaults to cut-off time. It lists the messages held in the FIN Copy hold queue that have not yet been authorised. The response to this message is an MT 029 FIN Copy Message Status Report containing counts of messages queued by the FIN Copy Service.

See the FIN Copy Service Description module for further information.

From:FIN Copy Server    To: FIN


Notes:

When the <date-time> fields are absent, current <date-time> is assumed as the cut-off time. The
cut-off time is local to the FIN Copy Server.

If the request specifies the <date-time> field, the response provides the status as of the specified <datetime>.When only one field 177 is present, it is interpreted as the cut-off time; when both are present the first field 177 is interpreted as the start time. All times are local and are compared with the emission time of the
user messages

When field 243:<hold-queue-request-type> is 1, the MT 029 FIN Copy Message
Status Report provides the MIR for all messages in the hold queue. Otherwise, only the counts are provided.

Status Request has a tag 243 value of 3. Otherwise the length remains 2,000 characters.

See the FIN Copy Service Description module for further information.

From: FIN      To:FIN Copy Server

Notes:

The optional fields <date-time>, <service-code> and <cut-off-time-count> are only
present in the first section of the report.

When field 243:<hold-queue-request-type> of the MT 028 FIN Copy Message Status
Request is 1, the MT 029 FIN Copy Message Status Report provides the counts and MIRs for all messages in the hold queue. Otherwise, only the counts are provided.

Field 343 contains four 5-digit numbers, separated by a space. The sequence of numbers contains the following information
    • The number of status 1 urgent messages with an ACK time later than the start time (if given) and earlier than the cut-off or end times.
    • The number of status 2 urgent messages with an ACK time later than the start time (if given) and earlier
than the cut-off or end times.
• The number of status 1 normal messages with an ACK time later than the start time (if given) and
earlier than the cut-off or end times.
• The number of status 2 normal messages with an ACK time later than the start time (if given) and
earlier than the cut-off or end times.
If a message is status 1, this means that the FIN Copy message has been received by the SWIFT
system but the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message has not yet been received by
the Central Institution server.
If a message is status 2, this means that the MT 096 message has been received by the Central Institution
server, but the message has not yet been released by the server (that is, the message is in the FIN
Copy hold queue).

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

Notes


The two occurrences of field 177 specify a date-time range where the first field 177 is the start time and the second is the end time. The first field 177 must be a date not older than 30 days. If the start date is older than 30 days, the report received is empty. The second field 177 must not be more than seven days after the first field 177.

The 30 day period is a rolling window of exactly 30 x 24 hours back from the moment of the request, eg, if the request is sent at 11:05 local time, the report will provide information as from 11:05 local time 30 x 24 hours ago.]]></description>

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

		<description><![CDATA[This message provides statistical data for all closed GPA or FIN sessions during the requested time period.
The report is the response to an MT 031 Session History Request.


From: GPA or FIN To: User

============ ==========
Notes

Notes
The session information provided in the report is the same as that given in the session line of a QUIT or
LOGOUT acknowledgement including:
• session number
• date and time the session was opened
• date and time the session was closed
• a reason code, indicating the reason for the closure
• number of messages sent (ISNs used) in that session
• number of messages received (OSNs used) in that session
• first and last ISN used in that session
• first and last OSN used in that session.
For each LT, a separate total number of messages sent and received for all the sessions listed, is also stated.
See also the MT 081 Daily Check Report, which provides similar information on a daily basis.
In a major system failure (SP level 3 recovery), some session data may be irrecoverable. This data is shown
as zeros in field 331:<session-info>.
The 30 day period is a rolling window of exactly 30 x 24 hours back from the moment of the request, eg, if
the request is sent at 11:05 local time, the report will provide information as from 11:05 local time 30 x 24
hours ago.]]></description>

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

a service message, for example, a session control command, such as SELECT, or a logical acknowledgement, such as ACK/SAK/UAK

Users will be primarily concerned with identifier '01' which applies to all GPA and FIN system and user-to-user messages. Other values include: '21' for message acknowledgements such as ACK/NAK, UAK/UNK, '03' for SELECT commands, and 
so on]]></description>

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

		<description><![CDATA[This message is sent by a Test & Training user to specify the mode of the next FIN application test session. The LT can work in either the default Full Function Mode or in Local Test Mode. Current or, when available, Future Message Type formats can be selected.

From: User                To: GPA

Notes
-------
Modes and formats can be changed only when FIN is not selected. The change becomes effective immediately and remains in effect until either a further test mode selection is made, or the GPA session is terminated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages).

Requests for FIN broadcasts must always be addressed to SWHQBEBBXBCT. Requests for GPA broadcasts
must be addressed to SWHQBEBBABCT. Requests will normally be handled during normal Belgian working
hours (0900-1730 hours, Monday to Friday).
To request priority treatment of a Broadcast Request, field 128 must contain priority U. Broadcast Requests
with priority U will be handled inside or outside Belgian working hours and will be invoiced accordingly.
Please notify your CSC when sending an urgent Broadcast Request outside of Belgian working hours.
For FIN messages, the ninth character of the address must be X. For GPA messages it must be A.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.
