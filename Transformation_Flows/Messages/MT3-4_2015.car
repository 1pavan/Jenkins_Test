b)  Binary: An agreement under which a fixed amount is paid out if a specific condition is met at any time during the exercise period. The payment date of the amount is either when the condition is met (American) or at expiration date (European). The binary option has only "payment triggers".

c)  Digital: An agreement under which a fixed amount is paid out if a specific condition is met on expiration date. The digital option has only "payment triggers".

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

The system will replace the 'X' with a specific LT Code on delivery of the message according to the delivery control exercised by the receiving user.

The Branch Code is mandatory and will be validated. The default of 'XXX' may be used, as in the example above.

Unless otherwise documented, system messages addressed to the SWIFT system itself should be addressed to SWFTXXXXXXXX.

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy.

		<description><![CDATA[This message is exchanged to confirm a foreign currency option contract.

The confirmed transaction is covered by an ICOM (International Currency Option Master from the British Bankers' Association), ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association), Deutsche Rahmenvertrag, IFEMA, FEOMA or AFB (Association Française de Banques) Master Agreement. These agreements are either signed or under negotiation. The message also caters for deals that are not covered by the above agreements.

The message is used to confirm/notify the details of:

a)  a new contract between the parties,

b)  an amendment to a previously agreed contract,

c)  the cancellation of a confirmation,

d)  a trigger event: knock-in/knock-out of an option, hitting of a trigger level,

e)  the close out of an option.

It may also be used to report the details of a contract to a trade repository.

This message is exchanged by or on behalf of the institutions or corporates, party A and party B, which have agreed to a foreign currency option contract.



A money broker may also send this message to the two parties (party A and party B) for which he arranged the deal.


If there are two money brokers involved in arranging a deal between party A and party B, this message can also be exchanged between these money brokers.


Party A and party B are the legal entities which have agreed to the transaction.

Party A is either:

a)  the Sender, or

b)  the institution/corporate on behalf of which the message is sent, or

c)  one of the institutions for which the broker arranged the deal and to whom it is sending the confirmation, or

d)  when a money broker confirms to another money broker, the party for which the sending broker arranged the deal.

Party B is either:

a)  the Receiver, or

b)  the institution/corporate on behalf of which the message is received, or

c)  the other institution for which the broker arranged the deal, ie, party A's counterparty, or

d)  when a money broker confirms to another money broker, party A's counterparty.
Specifics of the instruments covered List of instruments
The options covered by the confirmation are:

a)  Vanilla options (American, European, Asian and Bermudan),

b)  Binary options (American or European),

c)  Digital options with single or double trigger level,

d)  Notouch options with single or double trigger level.

All options can also have a barrier. The barriers covered are single knock-in, single knock-out, double knock-in, double knock-out.

All options can be non-deliverable.
 Option styles
a)  Vanilla: The contract that provides the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying currency at a predetermined rate with expiration determined by the expiration style. The expiration style is European, American, Asian or Bermudan.

b)  Binary: An agreement under which a fixed amount is paid out if a specific condition is met at any time during the exercise period. The payment date of the amount is either when the condition is met (American) or at expiration date (European). The binary option has only "payment triggers".

c)  Digital: An agreement under which a fixed amount is paid out if a specific condition is met on expiration date. The digital option has only "payment triggers".

d)  Notouch: An agreement under which a fixed amount is paid unless a specific condition is met. The notouch option has only "no payment triggers".
 Expiration styles
a)  American: can be exercised on any date prior to and including expiration date as agreed by the parties to the trade.

b) Asian: can be exercised on the expiration date which is the last day of the determination period that is used to calculate the value of the underlying instrument of the option.

c)  European: can be exercised on expiration date, at or before expiration time.

d)  Bermudan or Mid-Atlantic: can be exercised on predetermined exercise dates as agreed to by the counterparts.
 Barriers
a)  Knock-in: The option has a specified spot level, which, if touched during the knock-in period, triggers the option into existence. Prior to that level being touched, no option exists.

b)  Knock-out: The option has a specified spot level, which, if touched during the knock-out period, terminates the option.
 Non deliverable options (NDO)
In respect of an exercise date under the non deliverable currency option transaction, the seller will pay to the buyer the In-the-Money amount, if positive, on settlement date in the settlement currency. The conditions and provisions as stated in the 1998 FX and Currency Option Definitions apply.

Some users have bilaterally agreed to confirm Non Deliverable Options in an MT 305 instead of an MT 306. This usage is based on bilateral agreements. ]]></description>

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

		<description><![CDATA[This message is exchanged to confirm a fixed term loan/deposit contract. 

The message is used to confirm/notify the details of: 
a) a new contract between the parties 
b) an amendment to a previously agreed contract 
c) the cancellation of a confirmation 
d) a rolled over/renewed contract between the parties 
e) the maturity of a contract. 

This message is exchanged by or on behalf of the institutions or corporates, party A and party B, who have agreed to a fixed term loan/deposit contract. 

A money broker may also send this message to the two parties (party A and party B) for which he arranged the deal. 

If there are two money brokers involved in arranging a deal between party A and party B, this message can also be exchanged between these money brokers. 

Party A and party B are the legal entities which have agreed to the transaction. 

Party A is either: 
a) the Sender, or 
b) the institution/corporate on behalf of which the message is sent, or 
c) one of the institutions for which the broker arranged the deal and to whom it is  sending the confirmation, or 
d) when a money broker confirms to another money broker, the party for which the sending broker arranged the deal. 

Party B is either: 
a) the Receiver, or 
b) the institution/corporate on behalf of which the message is received, or 
c) the other institution for which the broker arranged the deal, ie, party A's counterparty, or 
d) when a money broker confirms to another money broker, party A's counterparty.

The system will replace the 'X' with a specific LT Code on delivery of the message according to the delivery control exercised by the receiving user.

The Branch Code is mandatory and will be validated. The default of 'XXX' may be used, as in the example above.

Unless otherwise documented, system messages addressed to the SWIFT system itself should be addressed to SWFTXXXXXXXX.

S = System

U = Urgent

N = Normal

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Other PDMs may be added as a result of unsuccessful delivery attempts to the user.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<name>User Header</name>
						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

								<name>Delivery Monitoring</name>
								<description><![CDATA[Delivery monitoring options apply only to FIN user-to-user messages, and allow the sender of a message to request:

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[The PAC is used within the FIN Copy service only, when using the double authentication option. The PAC is included in Block 5 of FIN user-to-user messages, immediately after the MAC trailer, if present.

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<name>Possible Duplicate Emission</name>
						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Other PDMs may be added as a result of unsuccessful delivery attempts to the user.

where <mir> is that of the original user message whose fields are copied in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message.
Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

								<description><![CDATA[This character, used within FIN Application Headers only, defines the priority with which a message is delivered. The possible values are:

S = System

U = Urgent

N = Normal

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

								<name>Delivery Monitoring</name>
								<description><![CDATA[Delivery monitoring options apply only to FIN user-to-user messages, and allow the sender of a message to request:

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy.

The message also covers deals which are not part of an ISDA, Deutscher Rahmenvertrag für Finanztermingeschäfte or BBAIRS Master. In this case, party A and party B must have another bilateral agreement in place, except under AFB (Association Française de Banques) Master (until the AFB does define the interbank confirmation for cross currency swaps, the MT 361 cannot be used to confirm such transactions).

This message may also be sent by a money broker to the two parties (party A and party B) for which the broker arranged the deal.

If there are two money brokers involved in arranging a deal between party A and party B, this message is also exchanged between these money brokers.

The message may be used to:

a)  confirm the details of a new transaction between the parties

b)  correct a previously sent confirmation

c)  cancel a previously sent confirmation.

d)  report the details of a transaction to a trade repository.]]></description>

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

The first three characters are CrLf:

The field and the delimiter are present, that is, 32A:, 20:, and so on.

All subfields and their delimiters are present.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response.

The system will replace the 'X' with a specific LT Code on delivery of the message according to the delivery control exercised by the receiving user.

The Branch Code is mandatory and will be validated. The default of 'XXX' may be used, as in the example above.

Unless otherwise documented, system messages addressed to the SWIFT system itself should be addressed to SWFTXXXXXXXX.

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response. The format of the MRF is subject to change.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

Users will be primarily concerned with identifier '01' which applies to all GPA and FIN system and user-to-user messages. Other values include: '21' for message acknowledgements such as ACK/NAK, UAK/UNK, '03' for SELECT commands, and 
so on]]></description>

The system will replace the 'X' with a specific LT Code on delivery of the message according to the delivery control exercised by the receiving user.

The Branch Code is mandatory and will be validated. The default of 'XXX' may be used, as in the example above.

Unless otherwise documented, system messages addressed to the SWIFT system itself should be addressed to SWFTXXXXXXXX.

S = System

U = Urgent

N = Normal

Message Priority 'S' must be used for user-to-system messages; for user-to-user messages either 'U' or 'N' can be used. In the absence of user-specified delivery criteria, system messages are always delivered first, followed by urgent priority messages and then normal priority messages.

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

This is calculated on the extracted fields of Block 4 of the message, the value of field 115, if present, and the <authentication-result> of the MAC trailer for Copy Services with double authentication.

Thus, the end-of-block indicator (CrLf-) is included in the PAC calculation, and the fields are defined as follows:

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

						<description><![CDATA[The User Header is an optional header available within FIN for user-to-user messages only. It appears in Block 3 of a SWIFT message, and allows users to provide their own reference within the headers for a particular message.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

								<name>Delivery Monitoring</name>
								<description><![CDATA[Delivery monitoring options apply only to FIN user-to-user messages, and allow the sender of a message to request:

automatic MT 011 Delivery Notification once the message has been delivered

automatic MT 010 Non-Delivery Warning if a message is not delivered within the specified obsolescence period (see below)

both, or neither, options. This may be requested on an individual message basis.

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification. 
If the message has priority 'U' then the user must request delivery monitoring option '1' or '3'. If the message has priority 'N', the user can request delivery monitoring option '2', or, by leaving the option blank, no delivery monitoring.

								<name>Obsolescence Period</name>
								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

The chosen option is expressed as a single digit:

1 = Non-Delivery Warning

2 = Delivery Notification

3 = Non-Delivery Warning and Delivery Notification.

								<description><![CDATA[The obsolescence period defines the period of time after which a Delayed Message (DLM) trailer is added to a FIN user-to-user message when the message is delivered. For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

A User Header can only be assigned by the sender of a message and, if assigned, will always appear on the output message copy. Relevant parts of the User Header will be repeated in related system messages and acknowledgements.

Block 3 may contain tag 113, defining banking priorities, and tag 108, which is a user reference. The user reference part of the User Header may be used as one of the selection criteria when retrieving a message.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

For urgent priority messages, it is also the period of time after which, if the message remains undelivered, a Non-Delivery Warning is generated.

The values for the obsolescence period are 003 (15 minutes) for 'U' priority, and 020 (100 minutes) for 'N' priority. An obsolescence period can only be specified when delivery monitoring has been requested (option 1 or 3 for urgent priority messages, option 2 for normal priority messages). If no delivery monitoring has been requested, and an obsolescence period is specified, the message will be NAKed with error code H25.

GPA input Application Headers are similar to their FIN equivalents except that GPA messages do not specify priority, delivery monitoring, nor obsolescence period.

The optional field tags 103 and 115 are also used in Block 3 for the FIN Copy service. The order of tags, when present, is 103, 113, 108 and 115.

An optional field tag 119 can be included in Block 3 of certain messages to specify that different validation rules are to be applied. Agreed code words in field 119 indicate what validation rules SWIFT will apply. If field 119 is present, it should appear after field 108

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is used by the destination of the message. It only applies to FIN user-to-user messages (Service Identifier 01, message categories reserved for banking messages). There can be multiple PDEs. The system does not verify the order nor restrict the number (except for maximum message length).

Correctly formatted PDE trailers applied to user-to-system messages are accepted by the system, but not processed. This means that the system does not check to see if the original message exists. Therefore, a retrieval request sent with a PDE trailer may be processed twice if the original message was received by the system.

Format:

{PDE:[<time><mir>]}

where <time><mir> refers to the emission of the previous possible issue.

Note: It can be added automatically by a CBT or manually by a user. It may be followed by the MIR and the time of its previous possible messages.

						<description><![CDATA[This trailer is added to all FIN user-to-user output messages that have exceeded their obsolescence period. If this trailer appears in GPA or FIN system messages, it must be ignored. This trailer has a tag only, and no value.

The Obsolescence Period is:

U = 15 minutes

N = 100 minutes

						<description><![CDATA[Added by the system to any output message (GPA and FIN Service Identifier 01) being resent because a prior delivery may be invalid. If a system PLT receives a report request with a PDM, the response has a plain PDM (without the optional delivery reference). Other PDMs may be added as a result of unsuccessful delivery attempts to the user. 
Format:
{PDM:[<time><mor>]}
where <time> and the Message Output Reference <mor> are that of the previous attempt.
Note: For messages recovered after a system failure, the optional fields may not be present.

						<description><![CDATA[The MRF trailer is used to specify the message reference of the original user message in MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Messages.
Format:
{MRF:<date><full-time><mir>}
where <mir> is that of the original user message whose fields are copied in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message.
Note: The MRF is specific to FIN Copy. The MRF trailer is automatically generated in the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message and can only be reused in field 109 of the MT 096 FIN Copy to Central Institution Message to identify the MT 096 to which the MT 097 is a response. The format of the MRF is subject to change.
